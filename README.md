🔐 Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
This project implements a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System that analyzes network traffic to detect malicious activities. The system uses a Random Forest model trained on real-world network datasets and is integrated with:

📊 Prometheus & Grafana for real-time monitoring

📧 Email alerts for critical threats

🌐 Flask API for receiving data and returning predictions

🔎 tshark (Wireshark CLI) for real-time packet capture and analysis (optional)

🎯 Objective
To reduce false positives and negatives in intrusion detection by leveraging machine learning, replacing static rule-based methods. The system provides:

High-accuracy intrusion prediction

Real-time alerts and observability

Integration with monitoring & DevOps tools

🧠 ML Model: Random Forest
✅ Why Random Forest?
Robust against overfitting

Handles imbalanced data well

Easy to interpret using feature importance

Performed best across evaluation metrics

📦 Installation
1. Clone Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ids-ml-system.git
cd ids-ml-system
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run Flask API
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Runs on http://localhost:5000

Metrics exposed at http://localhost:5000/metrics

Prometheus server on port 9090

🧪 API Usage
POST /predict
Uploads a .csv file and returns predicted labels.

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST -F 'file=@sample_input.csv' http://localhost:5000/predict
Sample Output:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "results": [
    {"prediction": 0, "label": "Normal"},
    {"prediction": 1, "label": "DoS"}
  ],
  "status": "success"
}
📧 Email Alerts
Alerts are sent to your configured Gmail when high-risk attacks like:

DoS, Brute Force, Web Attack, U2R are detected.

⚠️ Must configure Gmail App Password for this to work.

python
Copy
Edit
sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
app_password = "your_16_char_app_password"
📷 Insert Screenshot 2: Example of received email alert.

📊 Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
Prometheus Metrics Tracked:
flask_predictions_total – total predictions made

flask_success_total – successful requests

flask_errors_total – failed requests

flask_prediction_label_total{label="X"} – prediction count by class

Grafana Setup:
Run Prometheus with this config:

yaml
Copy
Edit
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'flask_ids_api'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:5000']
Import prebuilt dashboards from /dashboards (optional).

Launch Grafana at http://localhost:3000

📷 Insert Screenshot 3: Grafana dashboard showing live prediction metrics.

🌐 Real-Time Packet Detection (tshark Integration)
Optional but powerful!

Use Case:
tshark captures packets in .csv format.

Script uploads it to /predict endpoint.

If malicious activity is detected, alerts are triggered.

bash
Copy
Edit
tshark -i eth0 -T fields -e frame.time -e ip.src -e ip.dst ... > live_traffic.csv
curl -X POST -F 'file=@live_traffic.csv' http://localhost:5000/predict
📷 Insert Screenshot 4: Tshark command-line + API prediction result.
